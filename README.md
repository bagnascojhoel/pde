# Personal Development Environment (PDE)

While watching a Netflix's Software Engineer live stream ([ThePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/c/ThePrimeagen)), I came about the concept of PDE. It was mesmerizing to think about the advantages this approach brings to daily life. The main concept is that you adapt the tools to your workflow, not yourself to the tools. This brought me to the road of using I3 and NVim. These tools are highly customizable and have a keyboard-focused workflow. In the long haul, they speed up and create an organic development experience.

I also intend to employ a solution to a question which I learned on a book (I could not remember which one ): if something made it impossible to code on your computer, and you had to configure it from scratch, how much time would you take to set up it?

I got to a stage where I'm comfortable enough with I3. For Vim it's another story. I learned a few keymaps and already know that it can improve my text-editing speed, but I am not confident in using it all the time yet. And as I write this, I noticed that I was aiming too high, and that got me nowhere. I was trying to make the whole setup configurable with a simple command. I realized that I should just focus on the main parts. The ones that, if my machine goes down during an emergency, would allow me to quickly come back and fix the issue or help my team.
